title: Market Capitalization and Calculation
summary: Market capitalization, or market cap, is the total value of a company's outstanding shares, calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of shares. It categorizes companies into sizes like small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap, influencing investment decisions and risk assessments.
key_points:
  - Market cap is calculated by multiplying the price per share by the number of shares outstanding.
  - Companies are categorized by market cap into sizes such as mega-cap, large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and nano-cap.
  - Market cap helps investors assess a company's size, market value, and potential risks and growth opportunities.
  - Market cap changes when share price moves or the share count changes (buybacks or new issuance).
  - Market cap is not the same as company value because debt and cash are excluded.
examples:
  - A stock trading at $10 with 1 million shares has a market cap of $10 million.
  - If a company issues more shares, its market cap can rise even if the share price stays the same.
