title: Market Capitalization and Calculation
summary: Market capitalization, or market cap, represents the total market value of a company’s equity and is one of the most widely used measures of company size. It helps investors classify companies, assess risk profiles, and align investments with growth or stability objectives. This lesson explains how market cap is calculated, how it changes, and why it differs from other valuation measures.
key_points:
  - Market cap is calculated as share price multiplied by shares outstanding.
  - It categorizes companies into size groups such as mega-cap, large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and nano-cap.
  - Market cap helps investors compare companies and construct diversified portfolios.
  - Changes in share price or share count directly affect market cap.
  - Market cap measures equity value only and does not include debt or cash.
  - Investors often use market cap to infer risk, growth potential, and volatility.
examples:
  - Basic calculation example:
        A company with 1 million shares outstanding trading at $10 per share.
        The market cap is $10 million, classifying it as a small-cap company.
  - Share issuance example:
        A company issues additional shares while its stock price remains unchanged.
        Market cap increases even though individual share value does not.
  - Comparison example:
        Two companies have the same stock price, but one has ten times more shares outstanding.
        The company with more shares has a much larger market cap and is typically less volatile.
