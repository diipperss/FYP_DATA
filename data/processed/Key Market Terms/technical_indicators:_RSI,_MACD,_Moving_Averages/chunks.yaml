title: Technical Indicators: RSI, MACD, and Moving Averages
summary: Technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, and moving averages help traders analyze momentum, trend direction, and potential reversals. Each indicator captures different aspects of price behavior, and using them together provides a more balanced technical perspective. This lesson explains how these indicators work, how they differ, and how traders combine them effectively.
key_points:
  - RSI measures momentum and identifies overbought or oversold conditions.
  - MACD analyzes momentum and trend strength using exponential moving averages.
  - Moving averages smooth price data to highlight trend direction.
  - MACD crossovers often signal changes in momentum.
  - RSI divergence can warn of weakening trends.
  - Indicators are lagging and should be confirmed with price action and risk management.
examples:
  - Overbought example:
        RSI rises above 70 while price continues climbing.
        Momentum is strong, but risk of a pullback increases.
  - Crossover example:
        The MACD line crosses above the signal line.
        Traders may interpret this as bullish momentum.
  - Trend example:
        The 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average.
        Often interpreted as a long-term bullish trend signal.
definitions:
  - term: MACD
    definition: A momentum indicator that measures the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs), typically a 12-period and 26-period EMA. It includes a signal line derived from a nine-day EMA of the MACD line.
  - term: RSI
    definition: A momentum indicator that gauges price changes relative to recent highs and lows, indicating overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions.
  - term: Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    definition: A type of moving average that gives more weight to recent prices, used in calculating indicators like MACD.
  - term: Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    definition: A moving average that gives equal weight to all prices in the lookback period.
  - term: Crossover
    definition: A signal that occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses above or below a longer-term moving average.
  - term: Divergence
    definition: A situation where price moves in one direction while an indicator moves in the opposite direction, hinting at weakening momentum.
  - term: Whipsaw
    definition: Choppy market conditions that cause frequent false signals.
common_mistakes:
  - Confusing the purpose of MACD and RSI, leading to conflicting trading signals.
  - Overreliance on a single indicator without considering how they interact.
  - Treating RSI overbought or oversold levels as automatic buy or sell signals.
questions_to_think:
  - How do MACD and RSI differ in their approach to measuring market momentum?
  - What are the limitations of using only one of these indicators for trading decisions?
  - How can traders effectively combine MACD and RSI to enhance their technical analysis?
  - How can moving averages help filter noise?
  - What role does risk management play when using indicators?
