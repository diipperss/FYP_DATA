title: Volatility Measures: Beta, ATR, Implied Volatility
summary: Volatility measures describe how much and how quickly prices change, helping investors assess risk, position sizing, and potential losses. Different measures capture different dimensions of volatility, from market sensitivity to daily price ranges and future expectations. This lesson explains key volatility metrics and how they are used in practice.
key_points:
  - Volatility reflects the magnitude and frequency of price fluctuations.
  - Standard deviation measures total historical volatility.
  - Beta compares an asset’s volatility to the broader market.
  - ATR measures typical daily price movement.
  - Bollinger Bands visualize volatility through price dispersion.
  - Maximum drawdown focuses on worst-case historical losses.
  - Implied volatility reflects market expectations of future uncertainty.
examples:
  - Market sensitivity example:
        A stock with a beta of 1.5 moves more aggressively than the market.
        Higher potential returns come with higher downside risk.
  - Trading example:
        ATR rises sharply after an earnings announcement.
        Traders may widen stop-loss levels to account for larger price swings.
  - Options example:
        Implied volatility increases ahead of major economic events.
        Option prices become more expensive due to higher expected uncertainty.
