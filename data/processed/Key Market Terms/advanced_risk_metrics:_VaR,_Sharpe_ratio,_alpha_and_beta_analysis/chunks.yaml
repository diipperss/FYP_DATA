title: Risk Measures
summary: Risk measures are quantitative tools used to evaluate the uncertainty, volatility, and potential downside of investments. They help investors understand not just how much an asset can return, but how risky those returns are relative to benchmarks, the broader market, and alternative investments. This lesson explains the most common risk measures—alpha, beta, R-squared, standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, and Value at Risk (VaR)—and shows how they work together to support better portfolio construction and risk management.
key_points:
  - Risk measures quantify different dimensions of investment risk, such as volatility, market sensitivity, and downside potential.
  - They allow investors to compare assets and funds on a risk-adjusted basis rather than on returns alone.
  - Alpha measures excess return relative to a benchmark, helping assess manager skill or strategy effectiveness.
  - Beta measures sensitivity to market movements, indicating how much an investment may amplify or dampen market returns.
  - R-squared measures how closely an investment’s movements track its benchmark, indicating how meaningful beta and alpha are.
  - Standard deviation measures total return volatility, reflecting how widely returns fluctuate around the average.
  - The Sharpe ratio combines return and risk to show how much excess return is earned per unit of volatility.
  - Value at Risk (VaR) focuses on downside risk by estimating potential losses under normal market conditions.
  - No single risk measure is sufficient; investors should interpret them together for a complete risk picture.
examples:
  - Alpha example:
        A mutual fund earns 9% in a year while its benchmark index returns 7%, after adjusting for market exposure.
        A positive alpha of 2% suggests the fund added value beyond market movements, potentially indicating skill or an effective strategy.
  - Beta example:
        A stock with a beta of 1.4 tends to move 40% more than the overall market.
        The stock may outperform strongly in rising markets but also experience larger losses during downturns.
  - R-squared example:
        A fund has an R-squared of 95 when compared to its benchmark index.
        The fund closely tracks the benchmark, making its alpha and beta more meaningful and reliable.
  - Standard deviation example:
        Two funds have the same average return, but one shows much wider fluctuations in monthly returns.
        The fund with higher standard deviation is riskier, even if long-term returns appear similar.
  - Sharpe ratio example:
        Fund A has a Sharpe ratio of 1.2, while Fund B has a Sharpe ratio of 0.6.
        Fund A delivers more return per unit of risk, making it more attractive for risk-adjusted performance.
  - VaR example:
        A portfolio has a one-day VaR of $1,000 at a 95% confidence level.
        Under normal conditions, daily losses are expected to exceed $1,000 only 5% of the time.
definitions:
  - term: Alpha
    definition: A measure of an investment’s excess return relative to a benchmark after accounting for market risk.
  - term: Beta
    definition: A measure of how sensitive an investment’s returns are to movements in the overall market.
  - term: R-Squared
    definition: A statistical measure showing how closely an investment’s performance is correlated with its benchmark.
  - term: Standard Deviation
    definition: A measure of the dispersion of returns around their average, commonly used as a proxy for volatility.
  - term: Sharpe Ratio
    definition: A risk-adjusted return metric calculated by dividing excess return by standard deviation.
  - term: Value at Risk (VaR)
    definition: An estimate of the maximum expected loss over a specified time period at a given confidence level.
  - term: Benchmark
    definition: A reference index used to evaluate investment performance and risk.
  - term: Risk-Free Rate
    definition: The return on a theoretically riskless investment, often approximated by government treasury bills.
common_mistakes:
  - Evaluating investments based only on returns without considering risk measures.
  - Interpreting beta without checking R-squared, which can make beta misleading.
  - Assuming standard deviation captures all types of risk, including extreme events.
  - Treating alpha as permanent rather than potentially temporary or market-dependent.
  - Using a single risk metric instead of a combination.
questions_to_think:
  - Why is it important to consider both risk and return when comparing investments?
  - How do beta and standard deviation measure different types of risk?
  - Why does a low R-squared limit the usefulness of alpha and beta?
  - In what situations might VaR underestimate true risk?
  - How can risk measures improve portfolio diversification decisions?
