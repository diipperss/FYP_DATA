title: Bid Ask Spread: How It Works and Why It Matters
summary: The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. It represents the cost of trading, with narrower spreads indicating higher liquidity and wider spreads indicating lower liquidity. This article explains how bid and ask prices are determined, their impact on trading, and factors that influence the spread.
key_points:
  - Bid and ask prices represent the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept.
  - The bid-ask spread is the difference between these two prices and reflects the cost of trading.
  - More liquid markets have tighter bid-ask spreads, while volatile or illiquid markets have wider spreads.
  - Market makers set bid and ask prices, profiting from the spread.
  - The spread indicates a security's liquidity, with tighter spreads meaning higher liquidity.
  - A wider spread can make it harder for short-term traders to profit.
examples:
  - Blue-chip companies like those in the Dow Jones may have a bid-ask spread of just a few cents.
  - Small-cap stocks trading less than 10,000 shares daily might have spreads of $0.50 or more.
  - If the bid is $9.95 and the ask is $10.05, the spread is $0.10.
