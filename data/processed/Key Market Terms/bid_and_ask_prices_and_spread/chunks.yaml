title: Bid Ask Spread: How It Works and Why It Matters
summary: The bid-ask spread represents the gap between what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are willing to accept for a security. It is a direct trading cost and a key indicator of liquidity. This lesson explains how bid and ask prices are set, why spreads vary across securities, and how understanding the bid-ask spread can help investors trade more efficiently and reduce hidden costs.
key_points:
  - The bid price reflects demand, while the ask price reflects supply.
  - The bid-ask spread represents an implicit transaction cost paid by traders.
  - Highly liquid securities typically have narrow spreads.
  - Illiquid or volatile securities tend to have wider spreads.
  - Market makers facilitate trading by continuously quoting bid and ask prices.
  - The spread compensates market makers for providing liquidity and bearing risk.
  - Wider spreads disproportionately affect short-term traders and frequent trading strategies.
examples:
  - Liquidity example:
        A large-cap stock trades with a bid of $50.00 and an ask of $50.02.
        The narrow $0.02 spread indicates high liquidity and low trading costs.
  - Illiquidity example:
        A small-cap stock trades with a bid of $9.50 and an ask of $10.10.
        The wide spread increases trading costs and makes entering or exiting positions more expensive.
  - ETF example:
        A popular index ETF trades with a consistently tight spread during market hours.
        Investors can buy or sell efficiently without sacrificing much value to transaction costs.
