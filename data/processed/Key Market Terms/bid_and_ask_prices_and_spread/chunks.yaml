title: Bid Ask Spread: How It Works and Why It Matters
summary: The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. It represents the cost of trading, with narrower spreads indicating higher liquidity and wider spreads indicating lower liquidity. This article explains how bid and ask prices are determined, their impact on trading, and factors that influence the spread.
