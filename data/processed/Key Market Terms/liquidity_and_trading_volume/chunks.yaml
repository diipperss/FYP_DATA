title: Volume vs Liquidity
summary: Volume and liquidity are closely related but fundamentally different concepts in financial markets. Volume measures how many shares trade over a period of time, while liquidity describes how easily an asset can be bought or sold at or near its current market price without causing large price changes. This lesson clarifies the distinction, explains why liquidity matters more for most investors, and shows how tools like bid-ask spreads and order book depth provide better insight than volume alone.
key_points:
  - Volume measures trading activity, while liquidity measures ease and cost of trading.
  - High volume does not always guarantee high liquidity.
  - Liquidity reflects how quickly an asset can be traded with minimal price impact.
  - Bid-ask spread is one of the clearest real-time indicators of liquidity.
  - Order book depth shows how much buying and selling interest exists at different price levels.
  - Average daily volume (ADV) helps compare activity across time but does not capture trading costs.
  - Investors generally prioritize liquidity because it directly affects execution quality and risk.
examples:
  - High liquidity example:
        A large-cap stock trades millions of shares daily and consistently shows a narrow bid-ask spread.
        Investors can enter and exit positions quickly with minimal trading costs or price slippage.
  - Volume vs liquidity example:
        Two stocks trade 500,000 shares per day, but one has a $0.01 spread while the other has a $0.30 spread.
        Despite similar volume, the stock with the tighter spread is far more liquid and cheaper to trade.
  - Low volume example:
        A micro-cap stock trades only a few thousand shares per day.
        Low liquidity increases execution risk, making it harder to buy or sell without moving the price.
