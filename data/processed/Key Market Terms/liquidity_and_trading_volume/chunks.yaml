title: Volume vs Liquidity
summary: The article explains the distinction between volume and liquidity in stock trading, emphasizing that while they are related, they are different concepts. It highlights that liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be bought or sold, whereas volume indicates the number of shares traded. Investors should prioritize liquidity over volume when making investment decisions.
key_points:
  - Volume and liquidity are distinct but related concepts in stock trading.
  - Liquidity refers to the speed and ease with which an asset can be traded at its market price.
  - Lower trade volume indicates lower market interest and less frequent trading of a security.
  - Bid-ask spread and order book depth are practical clues for liquidity.
  - Average daily volume (ADV) helps compare how actively a stock trades across days.
  - Investors focus more on liquidity as it has clearer implications and is better understood.
  - Volume is often misunderstood and requires expert analysis for accurate interpretation.
examples:
  - Securities with high liquidity can be quickly bought or sold without significant price changes.
  - Low volume securities are traded less frequently, indicating lower market interest.
  - Two stocks can have similar volume, but the one with a tighter bid-ask spread is usually easier to trade.
