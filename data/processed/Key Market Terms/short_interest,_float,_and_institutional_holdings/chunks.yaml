title: 5 Short Interest Metrics That Drive Stock Prices
summary: Short interest data provides insights into bearish bets, helping traders identify potential short squeezes, avoid crowded trades, and anticipate price movements. Understanding these metrics enhances analysis by gauging market sentiment and conviction levels.
key_points:
  - Short interest measures shares sold short but not yet covered.
  - High short interest indicates significant bearish sentiment.
  - Short sellers must buy back shares to close positions, creating buying pressure.
  - Short interest data is reported twice monthly by FINRA.
  - Short squeeze potential increases with higher short float percentages.
  - Days to cover estimates how long it might take shorts to buy back shares based on average volume.
  - Institutional holdings can reduce the tradable float and affect how crowded a short trade becomes.
examples:
  - Company A (50 million shares short, 2 billion outstanding) vs. Company B (5 million short, 20 million outstanding) shows Company B is more crowded.
  - GameStop's short squeeze in 2021 with over 100% short interest.
  - A stock with 5 days to cover may be harder for shorts to exit quickly if price rises.

  - term: Float
    definition: Shares available for public trading, excluding insider holdings and restricted stock.

  - term: Short Squeeze
    definition: A situation where a heavily shorted stock starts rising, forcing short sellers to buy back shares and driving prices higher.
  - term: Days to Cover
    definition: Short interest divided by average daily volume, estimating how many trading days it may take for shorts to cover.
  - term: Borrow Fee
    definition: The interest-like cost paid to borrow shares for short selling, which often rises when shares are scarce.
  - term: Institutional Holdings
    definition: Shares held by large investors such as mutual funds, pensions, and ETFs, which can reduce available float.
