title: 5 Short Interest Metrics That Drive Stock Prices
summary: Short interest metrics provide insight into bearish sentiment, market positioning, and potential supply-demand imbalances. By analyzing how many shares are sold short and how easily those positions can be closed, investors can better assess short squeeze risk, market conviction, and price volatility. This lesson explains the most important short interest metrics and how to interpret them.
key_points:
  - Short interest measures the number of shares sold short but not yet covered.
  - High short interest reflects strong bearish sentiment or hedging activity.
  - Short sellers must eventually buy shares back, creating future demand.
  - Short float percentage shows how crowded a short trade is.
  - Days to cover estimates how quickly shorts could exit based on trading volume.
  - Institutional ownership reduces tradable float and can amplify squeeze risk.
  - Short interest data is delayed and should not be treated as real-time.
examples:
  - Crowding example:
        Company A has 5 million shares short with a float of 20 million shares.
        A high short float percentage indicates crowded positioning and higher squeeze risk.
  - Historical example:
        GameStop experienced short interest exceeding 100% of its float in 2021.
        Extreme crowding led to forced buying and rapid price escalation.
  - Liquidity example:
        A stock with 6 days to cover faces rising prices on heavy buying.
        Shorts may struggle to exit quickly, increasing volatility.
definitions:
  - term: Short Interest
    definition: The total number of shares that investors have sold short and not yet repurchased or covered.
  - term: Short Float Percentage
    definition: Short interest as a percentage of a stock’s float, indicating how crowded the short trade is.
  - term: Float
    definition: Shares available for public trading, excluding insider holdings and restricted stock.
  - term: Short % of Outstanding Shares
    definition: Short interest as a percentage of total shares outstanding, providing a different perspective than short float percentage.
  - term: Short Squeeze
    definition: A situation where a heavily shorted stock starts rising, forcing short sellers to buy back shares and driving prices higher.
  - term: Days to Cover
    definition: Short interest divided by average daily volume, estimating how many trading days it may take for shorts to cover.
  - term: Borrow Fee
    definition: The interest-like cost paid to borrow shares for short selling, which often rises when shares are scarce.
  - term: Institutional Holdings
    definition: Shares held by large investors such as mutual funds, pensions, and ETFs, which can reduce available float.
common_mistakes:
  - Confusing short float percentage with short interest numbers.
  - Ignoring the impact of float size on short squeeze potential.
  - Failing to consider volume and relative strength in analyzing short interest.
  - Treating short interest as real-time data, even though reports are delayed.
