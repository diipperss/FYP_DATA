title: 5 Short Interest Metrics That Drive Stock Prices
summary: Short interest data provides insights into bearish bets, helping traders identify potential short squeezes, avoid crowded trades, and anticipate price movements. Understanding these metrics enhances analysis by gauging market sentiment and conviction levels.

examples:
  - Company A (50 million shares short, 2 billion outstanding) vs. Company B (5 million short, 20 million outstanding) shows Company B is more crowded.
  - GameStop's short squeeze in 2021 with over 100% short interest.
