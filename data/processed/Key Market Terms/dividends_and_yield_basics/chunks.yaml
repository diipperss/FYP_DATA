title: Dividend Yield: What It Is and How to Calculate It
summary: Dividend yield is a financial metric that shows the annual dividend payment relative to a stock's market price. It helps investors understand the return on investment from dividends alone, and its calculation involves dividing the annual dividends per share by the price per share. Understanding this ratio is crucial for evaluating a company's financial health and potential for growth.
key_points:
  - Dividend yield measures a company's annual dividends relative to its stock price.
  - It is calculated by dividing annual dividends per share by the price per share.
  - A high dividend yield may indicate either a high dividend or a low stock price, but it can also signal financial distress if the stock is declining rapidly.
  - Dividend yield can be calculated using trailing 12 months of dividends or the last full year's financial report.
  - Companies that consistently pay and increase dividends are often seen as financially stable.
  - Dividend yield changes when the stock price changes, even if the dividend stays the same.
examples:
  - Example 1: If a company pays $2 per share in annual dividends and its stock price is $40, the dividend yield would be 5%.
  - Example 2: A stock with a high dividend yield might be a REIT, MLP, or BDC due to their pass-through taxation structure.
  - Example 3: A stock price drop from $50 to $40 raises yield from 4% to 5% if the dividend stays $2.
