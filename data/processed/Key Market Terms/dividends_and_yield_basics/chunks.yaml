title: Dividend Yield: What It Is and How to Calculate It
summary: Dividend yield measures the income an investor receives from dividends relative to a stock’s market price. It is a key metric for income-focused investors and provides insight into a company’s dividend policy, stability, and valuation. This lesson explains how dividend yield is calculated, what influences it, and how to interpret it alongside other financial ratios.
key_points:
  - Dividend yield shows the cash income return from dividends alone.
  - It is calculated as annual dividends per share divided by the current share price.
  - Dividend yield changes as the stock price fluctuates, even if dividends remain constant.
  - A high dividend yield can signal strong income or potential financial stress.
  - Stable and growing dividends often indicate mature, financially healthy companies.
  - Dividend yield should be analyzed together with payout ratio and earnings sustainability.
examples:
  - Basic calculation example:
        A company pays $2 per share annually and trades at $40 per share.
        The dividend yield is 5%, providing a clear measure of income return.
  - Price movement example:
        A stock’s price falls from $50 to $40 while the dividend remains $2.
        The yield rises from 4% to 5%, which may reflect higher risk rather than improved fundamentals.
  - Sector example:
        REITs and utilities often show higher dividend yields than technology firms.
        These sectors may appeal more to income-focused investors than growth-oriented ones.
