title: Liquidity Provider vs Market Maker: What Is the Difference?
summary: >
  This lesson explains the difference between liquidity providers and market makers, two critical participants
  in modern financial markets. It clarifies how each contributes to liquidity, price stability, and efficient
  trade execution, while highlighting how their roles differ across asset classes such as equities, forex,
  and cryptocurrencies.
key_points:
  - Liquidity providers supply capital to markets, enabling large volumes of trades to occur smoothly.
  - Market makers continuously quote bid and ask prices, ensuring buyers and sellers can transact at any time.
  - Liquidity providers often operate behind the scenes, while market makers are visible in the order book.
  - Market makers earn compensation primarily through the bid-ask spread.
  - Both play essential roles in reducing volatility and improving price discovery.
  - Regulatory frameworks govern their activities to promote fair and transparent markets.
examples:
  - Market maker example:
        A market maker continuously posts a bid at $9.98 and an ask at $10.00 for a stock,
        committing to buy or sell at those prices.
        Investors can trade immediately without waiting for a counterparty, improving execution speed and reliability.
  - Liquidity provider example:
        A large financial institution supplies capital to an exchange, allowing thousands of trades
        to be matched efficiently during periods of high demand.
        Reduces price gaps and volatility, lowering transaction costs for both retail and institutional investors.
  - Asset class comparison example:
        Forex markets feature deep liquidity due to global banks acting as liquidity providers,
        while smaller cryptocurrencies rely on fewer market makers.
        Explains why spreads are tighter in major currency pairs and wider in smaller or less mature markets.
why_study_this:
  - Understanding these roles helps investors interpret spreads, liquidity, and execution quality.
  - It explains why some assets trade smoothly while others experience sharp price swings.
  - This knowledge is foundational for understanding market microstructure and order book behavior.
