title: Major Market Indices: S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Jones
summary: >
  This lesson explains what major market indices are, how they are constructed, and why they are widely used
  as benchmarks for market performance. It focuses on the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average,
  highlighting their differences in weighting, sector exposure, and relevance to investors.
key_points:
  - Market indices track the performance of a selected group of stocks.
  - The S&P 500 represents large-cap U.S. companies and is often used as a proxy for the overall market.
  - The Nasdaq Composite has a heavier concentration in technology and growth-oriented companies.
  - The Dow Jones Industrial Average tracks 30 major companies using a price-weighted methodology.
  - Index weighting methods influence how individual stocks impact index movements.
  - Investors use indices as benchmarks to evaluate portfolio and fund performance.
  - Understanding indices helps investors interpret market headlines more accurately.
  - Indices serve as foundations for ETFs, mutual funds, and passive investment strategies.
  - Knowing index composition prevents false assumptions about “the market.”
examples:
  - S&P 500 benchmark example:
        A diversified equity portfolio delivers a 9% annual return while the S&P 500 returns 11% over the same period.
        Investors can assess whether underperformance is due to market conditions or portfolio construction choices.
  - Nasdaq volatility example:
        During a technology sell-off, the Nasdaq declines more sharply than the S&P 500.
        Highlights higher growth exposure and volatility, helping investors align index exposure with risk tolerance.
  - Dow Jones weighting example:
        A high-priced Dow component rises significantly, moving the index despite representing a smaller company by market value.
        Demonstrates how price-weighted indices can behave differently from market-cap-weighted indices.
