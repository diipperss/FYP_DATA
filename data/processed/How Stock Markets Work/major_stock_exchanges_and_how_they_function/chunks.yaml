title: What Are Stock Exchanges?
summary: >
  This lesson introduces stock exchanges as the core infrastructure of financial markets.
  It explains how exchanges enable capital formation, facilitate trading, and support price discovery,
  while distinguishing between primary and secondary markets and different exchange structures.
key_points:
  - Stock exchanges form the backbone of modern investing.
  - Understanding exchange mechanics improves trade execution and cost awareness.
  - Knowledge of market structure helps investors interpret price movements and liquidity conditions.
  - Stock exchanges are organized marketplaces where securities are traded.
  - Companies use exchanges to raise capital through public listings.
  - Investors trade existing shares in secondary markets.
  - Modern exchanges rely on electronic systems to enable fast, high-volume trading.
  - Market makers and auction mechanisms help ensure liquidity and efficient pricing.
  - Different exchange models serve companies of varying sizes and regulatory requirements.
examples:
  - IPO example:
        A private company lists its shares on a major exchange, offering them to the public for the first time.
        Investors gain early access to a growing business, while the company raises capital for expansion.
  - Secondary market example:
        An investor buys shares of a well-known company from another investor on an exchange.
        Liquidity allows investors to enter or exit positions easily without affecting company operations.
  - Market maker example:
        A market maker continuously quotes buy and sell prices for a stock.
        Reduces trading friction and improves execution reliability, especially during volatile periods.
