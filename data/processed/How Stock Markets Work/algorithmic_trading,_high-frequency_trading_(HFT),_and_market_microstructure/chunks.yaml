title: Understanding Market Microstructure in High-Frequency Trading
summary: This article introduces the concept of market microstructure in electronic stock markets and explains how it relates to High Frequency Trading (HFT). It discusses the types of orders (market and limit) used in these markets, their execution mechanisms, and how liquidity affects trading outcomes. The text also highlights the importance of the Limit Order Book (LOB) and the implications of market order execution in illiquid versus liquid assets.
key_points:
  - Electronic markets have replaced traditional open outcry exchanges with faster computer-based systems.
  - Market orders (MO) are executed at the best available price, while limit orders (LO) specify a desired price for execution.
  - The Limit Order Book (LOB) contains all active limit orders and is crucial for understanding market dynamics.
  - Liquidity affects the execution of market orders: liquid assets have sufficient limit orders to fulfill MOs without needing to "walk the book," while illiquid assets may require this process, leading to worse average prices.
  - The article references a book on algorithmic and high-frequency trading as a valuable resource for further study.
examples:
  - A limit order to buy 1000 shares of Apple at $170 USD will only execute if someone sells at that price, and may be partially filled if the available quantity is less.
  - A market order to buy HPQ shares is likely to be fully executed at the best price due to high liquidity, whereas a similar order for FARO might require walking the book due to lower liquidity.
definitions:
  - term: Market Order (MO)
    definition: An order to buy or sell a financial instrument immediately at the best available price in the market.
  - term: Limit Order (LO)
    definition: An order to buy or sell a financial instrument at a specified price or better, which is only executed when the market reaches that price.
  - term: Limit Order Book (LOB)
    definition: A record of all active limit orders in the market, showing the quantity and price of pending buy and sell orders.
  - term: Walking the book
    definition: The process of executing a market order by sequentially going through each level of the Limit Order Book until the entire order is filled, which can result in a worse average price due to the urgency of the trade.
common_mistakes:
  - Confusing market orders with limit orders, leading to incorrect assumptions about execution speed and price.
  - Assuming all market orders are executed at the best price without considering liquidity and the need to walk the book in illiquid markets.
questions_to_think:
  - How does liquidity in the market affect the execution of market orders?
  - What are the implications of walking the book for traders in illiquid markets?
  - How do limit orders contribute to the formation and function of the Limit Order Book?
