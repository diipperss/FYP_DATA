title: The Importance of Order Book Depth in Day Trading
summary: >
  This lesson explains how order book depth reveals liquidity, market sentiment,
  and short-term price dynamics. It shows how traders use bid and ask data,
  order sizes, and order flow to make informed intraday decisions while managing risk.
key_points:
  - Order book depth shows liquidity at multiple price levels. It links liquidity, volatility, and execution risks, helping traders anticipate short-term price behavior and reinforcing the importance of risk management in fast-moving markets.
  - Large bid or ask clusters can indicate support or resistance.
  - Thin order books can amplify price movements.
  - Order flow provides insight into short-term market pressure.
  - Order book conditions change rapidly around news and market open/close.
  - Strategies like scalping, momentum trading, and reversal strategies for advanced learning.

examples:
  - Support level example:
        A stock shows large buy orders clustered at $99 and $100.
        Traders may view these levels as temporary support, influencing entry and stop placement.
  - Thin liquidity example:
        A small sell order causes a sharp price drop due to limited depth.
        Demonstrates increased risk in low-liquidity environments.
  - Scalping example:
        A trader exploits a brief liquidity gap to capture a small price movement.
        Highlights how order book depth enables short-term strategies but requires speed and discipline.
