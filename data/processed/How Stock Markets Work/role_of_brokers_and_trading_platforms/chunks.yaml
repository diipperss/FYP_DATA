title: What Is a Broker?
summary: >
  This lesson explains the role of brokers as intermediaries between investors and financial markets.
  It covers different broker types, how they earn revenue, the services they provide, and the regulatory
  responsibilities they carry, helping investors understand how trades are routed and executed.
key_points:
  - - Understanding broker incentives helps investors evaluate costs and execution quality.
  - Awareness of regulatory duties protects investors from conflicts of interest.
  - Brokers act as intermediaries between investors and securities exchanges.
  - There are two types of brokers: full-service and discount.
  - Brokers are regulated by FINRA in financial markets and by state agencies in real estate.
  - Brokers earn income through commissions, fees, or assets under management (AUM).  - Brokers help reduce exchange fees by maintaining inventory of shares.
  - The role of a broker varies between financial and real estate sectors.
  - Brokers must adhere to KYC rules and fiduciary standards for investment advice.
  - Trading platforms provide the tools to place orders, view prices, and manage portfolios.
  
examples:
  - Trade execution example:
        A high-net-worth investor places a large order through a broker, who breaks it into smaller trades
        to reduce market impact.
        Improves execution price and minimizes visible disruption to the order book.
  - Broker type example:
        A retail investor uses a discount broker app to place a limit order without receiving investment advice.
        Lower costs improve long-term returns, but responsibility for decision-making rests entirely with the investor.
  - Regulatory example:
        A broker verifies a client’s identity and risk profile before allowing derivatives trading.
        Protects investors from inappropriate risk exposure and supports market integrity.
