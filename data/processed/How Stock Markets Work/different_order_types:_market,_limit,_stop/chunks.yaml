title: Understanding Market, Limit, and Stop Orders
summary: This lesson explains the core order types—market, limit, stop, and stop-limit—and how they shape execution outcomes, risk management, and price control. It connects each order type to investor intent, market conditions, and liquidity, helping users choose the right tool for speed, precision, or protection.
key_points:
  - Market orders prioritize immediate execution but expose traders to price uncertainty.
  - Limit orders provide price control but may not execute if the market does not reach the specified price.
  - Stop orders are primarily used for risk management and automatically convert into market orders once triggered.
  - Stop-limit orders add price control after triggering but risk non-execution during fast price movements.
  - Time-in-force settings determine how long orders remain active and affect execution behavior.
examples:
  - Market order execution example:
        A trader submits a market order during a volatile earnings announcement, when prices are moving rapidly.
        Highlights how market orders can execute far from expected prices during high volatility, increasing slippage.

  - Limit order discipline example:
        An investor places a buy limit order below the current market price, waiting for a temporary pullback.
        Demonstrates price discipline but also the risk of missing the trade entirely if the stock continues rising.

  - Stop-loss protection example:
        A long-term investor sets a stop order below a key support level to limit downside risk.
        Automates risk management but may trigger prematurely during short-term market noise.

  - Stop-limit execution risk example:
        A stop-limit order triggers during a sudden sell-off but fails to execute because prices gap below the limit.
        Shows how controlling slippage can come at the cost of execution certainty.

  - Time-in-force oversight example:
        A good-til-canceled (GTC) limit order remains active for weeks without being monitored.
        Illustrates how forgotten orders can execute unexpectedly as market conditions change.
definitions:
  - term: Market Order
    definition: An order to buy or sell a stock at the market's best available price, ensuring execution but not a specific price.
  - term: Limit Order
    definition: An order to buy or sell a stock with a restriction on the maximum price to be paid (for a buy) or the minimum price to be received (for a sell), ensuring better execution prices but not guaranteed execution.
  - term: Stop Order
    definition: An order to buy or sell a stock at the market price once the stock has traded at or through a specified price (the "stop price"), which then becomes a market order.
  - term: Stop-Limit Order
    definition: A stop order that turns into a limit order once triggered, with a specific limit price.
  - term: Slippage
    definition: The difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which it is executed.
  - term: Time in Force
    definition: Instructions for how long an order remains active, such as day or good-til-canceled (GTC).
common_mistakes:
  - Confusing market orders with limit orders, leading to unexpected execution prices.
  - Not considering liquidity and market volatility when placing limit orders, which can result in unfilled orders.
  - Using stop orders without understanding the risk of slippage, which can lead to execution at prices significantly different from the stop price.
questions_to_think:
  - When would you use a market order instead of a limit order?
  - How can you adjust the risk of slippage when using stop orders?
  - What factors should you consider when setting the stop price for a stop order?
  - How does volatility change the effectiveness of stop and stop-limit orders?
  - How should liquidity influence order type selection?
