summary: >
  This lesson explains how stock markets operate across regular trading hours,
  pre-market, after-hours, and overnight sessions. It highlights how liquidity,
  spreads, and execution risks differ outside normal hours and what investors
  should consider when trading during these periods.
key_points:

  - Regular trading hours concentrate most liquidity and volume.
  - Pre-market and after-hours trading occur via electronic communication networks (ECNs).
  - Extended hours trading typically allows only limit orders due to lower liquidity.
  - Price volatility and wider spreads are more common outside regular sessions.
  - Overnight trading is broker-dependent and varies by market.
examples:
  - Earnings release example:
        A company releases earnings after market close, causing its stock to spike in after-hours trading.
        Early traders may capture price moves, but face higher risk due to thin liquidity.
  - Liquidity example:
        A limit order placed during pre-market hours fills only partially due to limited participation.
