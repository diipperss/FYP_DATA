title: Spin-Off vs. Split-Off vs. Carve-Out: An Overview
summary: Companies have different methods to divest assets, divisions, or subsidiaries, including spin-offs, split-offs, and carve-outs. These strategies aim to increase shareholder value and operational efficiency. The choice of method depends on various factors, with the ultimate goal of maximizing shareholder value.
key_points:
  - Spin-offs, split-offs, and carve-outs are methods for companies to divest assets or subsidiaries.
  - The choice of method depends on factors that aim to increase shareholder value and operational efficiency.
  - Spin-offs result in separate entities with their own management teams.
  - Split-offs require shareholders to choose between parent company shares or subsidiary shares.
  - Carve-outs often precede full spin-offs and can provide cash inflows to the parent company.
examples:
  - Baxalta's spin-off led to a takeover by Shire Pharmaceuticals, resulting in the formation of Takeda Biopharmaceuticals India Private Limited.
  - Bristol-Myers' split-off involved an exchange ratio of 0.6313 for Mead Johnson shares.
  - A carve-out example is when a subsidiary's stock is offered in an IPO with no more than 20% of the stock being sold to satisfy tax-free spin-off requirements.
definitions:

  - term: Split-Off
    definition: A method where shareholders are offered shares in a subsidiary but must choose between holding shares of the subsidiary or the parent company.
  - term: Carve-Out
    definition: A method where a subsidiary's stock is offered in an IPO with no more than 20% of the stock being sold to satisfy tax-free spin-off requirements, often preceding a full spin-off.
common_mistakes:
  - Confusing the exchange ratios in split-offs with those in spin-offs.
  - Assuming that all spin-offs are tax-free, not considering the structural requirements for tax-free status.
  - Not recognizing that carve-outs can provide cash inflows to the parent company.
questions_to_think:
  - How does the exchange ratio in a split-off affect the shareholder's decision to participate?
  - What are the implications of a carve-out on the parent company's financial position?
  - How do the tax implications of spin-offs differ from those of split-offs and carve-outs?
