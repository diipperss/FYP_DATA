title: Comparing Spin-Offs, Split-Offs, and Carve-Outs in Corporate Restructuring
summary: This lesson covers corporate restructuring methods—spin-offs, split-offs, and carve-outs—that separate business units to unlock shareholder value. It explains how each approach impacts ownership, cash flows, and strategic positioning, helping investors understand choices and consequences in corporate restructuring.
key_points:
  - Spin-offs, split-offs, and carve-outs are used to separate assets or divisions strategically.
  - Choice of method depends on objectives like operational focus, unlocking shareholder value, or raising cash.
  - Spin-offs create independent companies while retaining ownership in both entities.
  - Split-offs require shareholders to choose between parent company shares or subsidiary shares.
  - Carve-outs sell a minority stake in a subsidiary via IPO to generate cash while retaining control.
  - Restructuring impacts stock valuation by altering growth prospects, risk, and cash flow expectations.
examples:
  - Spin-off outcome example:
        Baxter International spun off Baxalta as a standalone company. Shareholders received shares in both companies, allowing separate valuation of the biotech business.
        Investors can assess and invest in the new company independently. Baxalta’s eventual acquisition by Shire Pharmaceuticals illustrates how spin-offs can reveal hidden value.
  - Split-off choice example:
        Bristol-Myers Squibb’s split-off of Mead Johnson gave shareholders the option to exchange parent company shares for subsidiary shares at a 0.6313 ratio.
        Shareholders had to evaluate which business they preferred to hold, directly affecting their exposure and risk.
  - Carve-out structure example:
        A parent company offers 20% of a subsidiary in an IPO, raising cash while retaining control; remaining shares may later be spun off.
        Investors gain partial ownership and can participate in future growth, while the parent benefits from liquidity and capital for strategic initiatives.
  - Strategic separation example:
        A diversified parent spins off a slower-growth division, letting the market value the mature business separately from the faster-growing core.
        Shareholders can better understand and evaluate growth potential and risk across distinct business units.
