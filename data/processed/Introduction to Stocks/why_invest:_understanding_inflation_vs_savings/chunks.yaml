title: Saving vs. Investing: What's the Difference?
summary: This lesson explains the fundamental differences between saving and investing, focusing on risk levels, time horizons, and objectives. It emphasizes that saving is suitable for short-term goals and emergencies, while investing is better for long-term wealth creation. The lesson also outlines the benefits of combining both strategies for a balanced financial plan.
key_points:
  - Saving and investing are strategies to accumulate money for future use, but they differ in risk, return, and time horizon.
  - Saving is appropriate for short-term goals (typically under five years) and emergency funds.
  - Investing is suitable for long-term goals, such as retirement or education, where compound growth can maximize wealth.
  - Savings accounts are low-risk and highly liquid, while investments carry higher risk but potential for greater returns.
  - Compound growth allows investments to generate earnings on prior earnings, making long-term investing powerful.
  - A well-rounded financial plan uses both saving and investing to achieve short-term security and long-term growth.
examples:
  - Short-term savings example: Saving for a vacation, home down payment, or emergency fund within five years.
  - Long-term investing example: Contributing to retirement accounts or college funds for children over decades to leverage compound growth.
  - Mixed approach example: Keeping three to six months of expenses in savings while investing additional funds in stocks or ETFs for long-term growth.
