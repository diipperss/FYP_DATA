title: Introduction to Stocks
summary: This lesson introduces stocks as the foundation of equity investing, explaining how they represent ownership in a corporation and why companies issue them. It connects stock ownership to shareholder rights, profit participation, and corporate financing, and sets the groundwork for understanding different stock types and market behavior.
key_points:
  - Stocks represent partial ownership in a corporation rather than direct ownership of its assets.
  - A stock is an equity security that gives shareholders a claim on a company’s profits and residual value.
  - Companies issue stocks to raise capital for growth without incurring debt obligations.
  - Ownership is divided into shares, which determine an investor’s proportional stake in the company.
  - Shareholders may receive dividends, but dividends are discretionary and depend on company performance and policy.
  - Voting power, not just share ownership, determines influence over corporate decisions.
  - The two main categories of stock are common and preferred, each with different rights and priorities.
examples:
  - Shares example: A shareholder owning 33% of a company’s shares owns one-third of the equity, not one-third of the physical assets or day-to-day control.
  - IPO example: A growing company launches an IPO to fund expansion, research, and marketing without borrowing money.
  - Shares example: An investor purchases common shares to gain voting rights and long-term growth potential rather than fixed income.
