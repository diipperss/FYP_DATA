title: Introduction to Stocks
summary: This lesson explains what stocks are, their role in corporate finance, and the different types of stocks available. It covers ownership, shareholder rights, and the distinction between common and preferred stock.
key_points:
  - Stocks represent ownership in a corporation.

  - There are two main types of stock: common and preferred.
  - Common shareholders usually have voting rights, while preferred shareholders often do not.

  - Companies issue stock to raise capital without taking on debt.
examples:
  - A shareholder owning 33% of shares does not own one-third of the company, but owns one-third of the shares.

  - An investor buys common shares to vote on board elections and potentially receive dividends.
