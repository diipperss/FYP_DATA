title: The Ultimate Guide to Stock Dilution
summary: This article explains stock dilution, its impact on share prices, and how it affects investor ownership. It covers share structure, types of dilution, and why dilution can lead to selling pressure and price drops.
key_points:
  - Stock dilution occurs when a company issues more shares, reducing existing shareholders' ownership stakes.
  - Share structure includes authorized shares, outstanding shares, free trading shares, and restricted shares.
  - Dilution can result from secondary offerings, warrant exercises, and stock acquisitions.
  - Dilution often leads to investor selling, causing stock prices to drop.
  - Understanding dilution is crucial for investors to assess the true value of their holdings.
  - Dilution can reduce earnings per share (EPS) even if total earnings stay the same.
  - Buybacks can offset dilution by reducing the number of outstanding shares.
examples:
  - If a company issues 1000 shares and an investor owns 100, their ownership stake is 10%. After another 1000 shares are issued, their stake drops to 5%.
  - Warrant exercises can lead to significant dilution as warrant holders often buy shares at discounted prices.
  - A company repurchases 200 shares after an issuance, partially restoring ownership percentages for remaining shareholders.
