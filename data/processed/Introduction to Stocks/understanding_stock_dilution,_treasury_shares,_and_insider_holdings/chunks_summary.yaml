title: Understanding the iShares Core Equity ETF and Its Investment Structure
summary: The iShares Core Equity ETF Portfolio is a passive investment fund that tracks the S&P/TSX 60 Index, representing Canada’s largest publicly traded companies. This lesson explains how the ETF provides diversification, low costs, and tax efficiency, while showing why understanding ETFs is important for building efficient portfolios and gaining broad market exposure without managing individual stocks.
key_points:
  - ETFs like iShares demonstrate how investors can efficiently gain diversified market exposure without owning individual stocks, making portfolio construction simpler and less risky.
  - Understanding passive strategies helps investors appreciate the trade-offs between cost, risk, and potential return compared to actively managed funds.
  - Knowledge of ETFs, diversification, and low-cost investing is essential for long-term wealth accumulation, especially for beginners and those building retirement portfolios.
  - iShares is BlackRock’s brand of ETFs, offering investors access to diversified markets, sectors, or investment strategies through a single security.
  - The iShares Core Equity ETF Portfolio tracks the S&P/TSX 60 Index, containing 60 of the largest and most liquid Canadian companies.
  - The ETF uses a passive investment strategy, aiming to replicate index performance instead of trying to outperform the market.
  - Holding many companies in one fund provides built-in diversification, reducing company-specific risk.
  - Low management expense ratios (MERs) reduce costs, which compounds into higher long-term returns.
  - ETFs are structured to be tax-efficient, minimizing taxes on capital gains or distributions compared to many mutual funds.
  - ETFs trade like individual stocks, offering liquidity and the ability to enter or exit positions quickly.
  - Understanding ETFs is important because they allow investors to:
      - Gain broad market exposure efficiently.
      - Reduce reliance on selecting individual stocks.
      - Manage risk and cost effectively.
examples:
  - Diversification example:
        Instead of buying shares of multiple banks, energy firms, and telecom companies individually, 
        an investor can purchase the iShares Core Equity ETF to gain exposure to all 60 companies in the S&P/TSX 60 Index at once.
        Simplifies portfolio management, reduces company-specific risk, and ensures investors participate in overall market performance rather than being overly dependent on a few stocks.
  - Cost efficiency example:
        Compared with actively managed mutual funds that charge higher fees and multiple trading commissions, 
        the ETF charges a single low MER, keeping costs minimal over time.
        Low fees allow a greater portion of investment returns to compound over the long term, improving net wealth accumulation.
  - Passive strategy example:
        The ETF automatically adjusts holdings as the S&P/TSX 60 Index changes, buying or selling shares to match the index weights without active management.
        Investors don’t need to monitor or adjust holdings manually, yet they still capture the performance of large-cap Canadian companies.
  - Liquidity example:
        Shares of the ETF can be bought or sold anytime during market hours, similar to a single stock.
        Provides flexibility for portfolio adjustments or accessing cash quickly without disrupting investment strategy.
