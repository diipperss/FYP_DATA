title: Introduction to Stocks
summary: Shares represent units of ownership in a company, available as common or preferred types. They allow investors to participate in the company's growth through dividends and capital gains, with preferred shares offering priority in distributions. Shares are non-reimbursable, and companies can repurchase or redeem them under specific conditions. Key aspects include ownership structure, types of shares, and regulatory frameworks.
key_points:
  - Shares are units of ownership in a company, available as common or preferred shares.
  - Common shares provide voting rights and residual claims on profits, while preferred shares have priority in distributions and typically no voting rights.
  - Shares are non-reimbursable, meaning companies aren't legally required to return investors' money.
  - Companies can issue, repurchase, or redeem shares, with authorized shares set by the board.
  - Publicly traded shares are regulated by the SEC, while private shares may be issued through stock options.
  - Fractional shares allow investors to purchase portions of a single share, making stock more accessible.
  - Outstanding shares represent the shares currently held by investors and insiders.
  - The share price and the number of shares together determine a company's market capitalization.
examples:
  - A company authorizes 10 million shares but issues only 8 million.
  - An investor with $100 could buy 0.1 shares of a stock priced at $1,000 per share.
  - A company buys back shares, reducing the number of shares outstanding and increasing each remaining shareholder's ownership percentage.
