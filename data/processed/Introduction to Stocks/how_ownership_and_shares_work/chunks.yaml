title: Introduction to Stocks and Share Ownership
summary: This lesson expands on stock ownership by explaining how shares define economic rights, control, and valuation. It links share issuance, ownership structure, and market capitalization to investor returns, while introducing practical concepts such as fractional shares and buybacks.
key_points:
  - Shares are standardized units of ownership that determine an investor’s economic and voting rights.
  - Common and preferred shares differ in voting power, income priority, and risk exposure.
  - Shares are non-reimbursable, meaning investors bear the risk of business performance.
  - Companies define authorized shares and control issuance through their boards.
  - Outstanding shares reflect current ownership and directly affect market capitalization.
  - Public shares are regulated, while private shares are often distributed through options or private placements.
  - Fractional shares increase accessibility by lowering capital requirements for investors.
examples:
  - Share issuance example: A company authorizes 10 million shares and issues 8 million, establishing ownership distribution and valuation.
  - Fractional share example: An investor with limited capital buys 0.1 shares of a $1,000 stock, gaining proportional exposure.
  - Buyback example: A company repurchases shares, reducing outstanding shares and increasing earnings per share for remaining investors.
