title: Understanding Corporate Actions
summary: This lesson explains corporate actions as strategic decisions that alter share structure, ownership, or investor returns. It links these actions to earlier concepts such as share count, valuation, and shareholder rights, helping investors understand how corporate decisions translate into portfolio outcomes.
key_points:
  - Corporate actions are initiated by companies and directly affect shareholders.
  - Actions may change share count, ownership structure, or cash flows.
  - Corporate actions are classified as voluntary or mandatory based on investor choice.
  - Stock splits adjust share count and price without changing total investment value.
  - Reverse stock splits consolidate shares to meet regulatory or listing requirements.
  - Dividends and spin-offs redistribute value to shareholders in different forms.
  - Brokerages provide tools to track and respond to corporate actions.
examples:
  - Forward stock split example: 
        A company with 10 million shares priced at $9 each executes a 3-for-1 forward stock split. 
        The total number of shares increases to 30 million, and the share price adjusts to $3. 
        Each shareholder’s proportional ownership remains unchanged, but the lower price can make shares more accessible to small investors and may improve liquidity.
        Investors now hold three times the number of shares they previously owned. 
        The total investment value remains the same, but they can trade shares more easily due to the lower per-share price.
  - Reverse stock split example:
        A company with 10 million shares priced at $9 each executes a 1-for-2 reverse stock split. 
        The total number of shares reduces to 5 million, and the share price increases to $18. 
        Reverse splits are often used to maintain minimum listing requirements or enhance the perceived value of a stock.
        Each investor’s total investment value stays the same, but the number of shares held decreases. 
        Reverse splits may reduce the number of small shareholders and can affect liquidity.
  - Dividend example:
        A company declares a cash dividend of $0.50 per share. 
        An investor holding 100 shares receives $50 in cash. 
        Dividends represent a direct return on investment and can influence total shareholder yield.
        Shareholders gain immediate income without selling shares. 
        The stock price may adjust downward on the ex-dividend date to reflect the payout.
  - Spin-off example:
        A parent company creates a new independent subsidiary and distributes its shares to existing shareholders. 
        For example, a shareholder holding 100 shares of the parent company may receive 10 shares of the new company.
        Investors gain ownership in a separate business in addition to their original holdings. 
        Spin-offs allow shareholders to participate in growth potential of the new company while retaining their stake in the parent company.
