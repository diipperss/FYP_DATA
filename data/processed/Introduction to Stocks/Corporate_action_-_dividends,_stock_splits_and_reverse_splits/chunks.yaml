title: Understanding Corporate Actions
summary: This article explains corporate actions such as stock splits, dividends, and mergers, and how they impact investments. It outlines voluntary and mandatory actions, examples, and steps to respond.
key_points:
  - Corporate actions are events that affect shareholder investments.
  - Voluntary actions require shareholder response, while mandatory actions are automatic.
  - Examples include stock splits, dividends, mergers, and spin-offs.
  - Stock splits change the number of shares and the price per share but not the total value of your position.
  - Reverse splits do the opposite and are often used to meet listing requirements.
  - Vanguard provides resources for accessing and participating in corporate actions.
examples:
  - Forward stock split example: 10 million shares at $9 each becomes 30 million shares at $3 each.
  - Reverse stock split example: 10 million shares at $9 each becomes 5 million shares at $18 each.
  - Cash dividend example: a company pays $0.50 per share, so an investor with 100 shares receives $50.
  - Spin-off example: a parent company gives shareholders shares in a newly independent subsidiary.
