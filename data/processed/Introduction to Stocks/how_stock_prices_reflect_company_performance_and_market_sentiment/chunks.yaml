title: How Stock Prices Reflect Fundamentals and Market Sentiment
summary: Stock prices are determined by both a company’s financial fundamentals and investor behavior in the market. This lesson explains how earnings, growth expectations, liquidity, market sentiment, and news interact to influence stock pricing, highlighting why prices can deviate from intrinsic value in the short term.
key_points:
  - Stock prices are shaped by fundamental value and market behavior.
  - Fundamental factors include earnings, revenue growth, cash flows, and long-term profit potential.
  - Technical and market factors include liquidity, trading volume, investor sentiment, and overall economic conditions.
  - News, guidance, and changing expectations can amplify or override fundamentals temporarily.
  - Supply and demand dynamics influence stock prices even when fundamentals remain stable.
  - Investor expectations often drive short-term price movements more than actual results.
examples:
  - Sector sentiment example:
        A retail company reports stable earnings, but negative news about overall consumer spending causes investors to sell across the sector, driving down the stock price.
        Investors may experience losses despite strong fundamentals, highlighting the importance of market sentiment and diversification.
  - Liquidity example:
        A large-cap stock trades millions of shares daily, allowing easy buying and selling without major price changes. A small-cap stock trades infrequently, so investors demand a lower price to compensate for illiquidity risk.
        Portfolio strategies should consider liquidity risk, especially in smaller or thinly traded stocks.
  - Expectations vs results example:
        A company beats last quarter’s earnings but fails to meet higher market expectations, causing a decline in stock price despite positive results.
        Understanding investor expectations is crucial, as price movements reflect sentiment relative to anticipated performance, not just absolute results.
  - Supply and demand example:
        Positive media coverage or analyst upgrades can increase demand for a stock, driving up its price even if the company’s fundamentals have not changed.
        Investors need to distinguish between short-term sentiment-driven moves and long-term fundamental value.
