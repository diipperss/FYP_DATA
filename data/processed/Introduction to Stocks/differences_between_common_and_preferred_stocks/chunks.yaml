title: Preferred vs. Common Stock: An Overview
summary: This lesson compares preferred and common stock by examining their rights, risks, and return structures. It links income stability, voting power, and liquidation priority to different investor goals, helping learners understand why companies issue multiple share classes and how each fits into a portfolio.
key_points:

  - Preferred stock shares bond-like features such as par value and callability.
  - Due to fixed income characteristics, preferred stock often shows lower price volatility than common stock.
  - Common stock offers greater upside through price appreciation but carries higher risk.
  - Companies use different stock classes to balance financing flexibility with investor preferences.
