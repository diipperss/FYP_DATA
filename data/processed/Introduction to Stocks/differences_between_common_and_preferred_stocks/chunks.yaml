title: Preferred vs. Common Stock: An Overview
summary: This text explains the differences between preferred and common stock, highlighting their distinct characteristics, such as income priority, voting rights, and dividend structures. It covers key aspects like bond-like features of preferred stock, dividend calculations, and the pros and cons of each stock type.
key_points:
  - Preferred stock shareholders have priority over common stock shareholders in receiving dividends and assets during liquidation.
  - Preferred stock typically does not grant voting rights, whereas common stock does.
  - Dividends for preferred stock are usually higher and fixed, while common stock dividends are variable and not guaranteed.
  - Preferred stock has bond-like characteristics: par value is the stated issue price used to calculate dividends, and callability lets the issuer redeem the shares at a set price after a certain date.
  - Because preferred dividends are fixed and priority-based, preferred shares often trade with lower price volatility than common stock.
  - Common stock offers greater growth potential and voting rights but is more volatile and has lower priority in liquidation.
examples:
  - Preferred stock example: a company issues $25-par preferred shares that pay a fixed 6% dividend and can be called back by the issuer after a set date.
  - Preferred stock example: investors choose preferred shares to prioritize steady income over voting rights.
  - Common stock example: shareholders participate in price appreciation and vote on board elections or major corporate actions.
  - Common stock example: growth-focused investors buy common shares to benefit from long-term company expansion.
