title: Preferred vs. Common Stock: An Overview
summary: This text explains the differences between preferred and common stock, highlighting their distinct characteristics, such as income priority, voting rights, and dividend structures. It covers key aspects like bond-like features of preferred stock, dividend calculations, and the pros and cons of each stock type.
key_points:
  - Preferred stock shareholders have priority over common stock shareholders in receiving dividends and assets during liquidation.
